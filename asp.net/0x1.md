## Know about your solution ##
<br>Here is the solution:<br>

### ClientApp ###
> This is where the fun starts. All your Angular 2 code will go here.<br><br>
> If you take a quick look in there now you’ll find a components folder inside the app folder.<br><br>
> Angular 2 is built on the concept of components.<br><br>
> Every bit of functionality you build into your app can be built as a component that can take inputs, provide outputs and be rendered at multiple places in your app.
### Components, components everywhere ###
>Everything is a component, including the App itself so you’ll notice an app component alongside counter, fetchdata, home and the navmenu.

>
> If you take a look at the app component you’ll see it consists of three files containing html, css and typescript.

>
>Visual Studio shows these three files together, with the typescript and css files nested below the html one. If you rename one, VS will automatically rename the other two.
>
> The app.component.html template uses bootstrap and acts as the main structure for the entire web app. Every other component will be rendered somewhere within this html.
>
```
<div class='container-fluid'>
    <div class='row'>
        <div class='col-sm-3'>
            <nav-menu></nav-menu>
        </div>
        <div class='col-sm-9 body-content'>
            <router-outlet></router-outlet>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```
> The nav-menu component is rendered in a div whose size is determined by the bootstrap grid system (col-sm-3 in this case).<br><br>
> Every Angular 2 component can be included in your app using a custom selector which you specify when you create the component. In this case the nav menu has a selector of “nav-menu”.<br><br>
> The template also uses the special router-outlet selector which taps into the angular routing engine. Whenever an angular 2 route is accessed, the relevant html for that route will be rendered in place of this router-outlet selector. More on routing later.<br><br>
Now take a look at the app.component.ts.
```
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
 
@Component({
    selector: 'app',
    template: require('./app.component.html'),
    styles: [require('./app.component.css')]
})
export class AppComponent {
}
```
>This is about as simple as an Angular 2 component gets.
>
>You can see that the component uses the app.component.html file for its template and the app.component.css file for styles.
>
>By exporting the AppComponent class you ensure you will be able to access it elsewhere in your Angular 2 application.

## Creat First Component ##
1. Start by creating a new **demo** folder inside the **app/components** folder.

2. Add a new **demo.component.ts** file to it.

![add new component](https://i2.wp.com/jonhilton.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/helloworld.png?resize=833%2C448&ssl=1)

3. Add a new **demo.component.html** file to it.

4. Now replace the contents of demo.component.ts with:

```
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
 
@Component({
    selector: 'demo',
    template: require('./demo.component.html')
})
export class DemoComponent {
}
```

5. Update the demo.component.html with:

```
<div class="panel panel-info">
    <div class="panel-heading">
        Hello World
    </div>
   <div class="panel-body">
       Here's some text to get us started....
   </di
```

## Register the Component ##
1. Add import in **app.module.shared.ts** under **app/components**:

```
import { HelloWorldComponent } from './components/helloworld/helloworld.component';
```

2. Add `@NgModule`:

```
DemoComponent // Same with export class DemoComponent
```

3. Using your Component

Now you can user your component with `<demo></demo>`,which is the selector name, in html files like:

```
<h1>Hello, world!</h1>
 
<helloworld></helloworld>
