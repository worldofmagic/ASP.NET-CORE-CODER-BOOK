# Installation
1. **Make sure you have the prerequisites**
- ASP.NET Core RC2
- Node.js. If you’re on Windows, make sure your installation is new enough to have NPM version 3+ (run npm -v to find out) otherwise you’ll have a bad time.
2. **Install yeoman and the aspnet-spa generator**
```
npm install -g yo generator-aspnetcore-spa
npm install -g webpack
```
3. **Create your new project**
```
cd some-empty-directory
yo aspnetcore-spa
```
4. **Run it**
```
dotnet run
```
5. **Try it in development mode**. Set the environment variable and then restart dotnet run. 
-  On Windows, that’s:
```
set ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development
dotnet run
```
-  on Mac/Linux:
```
export ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development
dotnet run
```
6. **Make a production build**. Set the `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` variable to `Production` and then run:
```
webpack --config webpack.config.vendor.js
webpack
```
